<h1>MOTHERBOARD</h1>
<p>A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, system board, baseboard, planar board, logic board,[1] and mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.

Motherboard means specifically a PCB with expansion capabilities. As the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the "mother"
 of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface cards, and daughtercards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, 
hard drives, and other forms of persistent storage; TV tuner cards, cards providing extra USB or FireWire slots; and a variety of other custom components.</p>
