<font face = "Comic Sans MS" align = "center" color = "orange"><p>Web application development is the process and practice of developing web applications. There is a consensus that the processes involved are extensions of standard software engineering processes.[1] Considering this, along with its unique characteristics, popular frameworks used include the spiral approach and business-oriented approach to application development, among other models that address the requirements for an iterative process.[1]

Just as with a traditional desktop application, web applications have varying levels of risk. A personal home page is much less risky than, for example, a stock trading web site. For some projects security, software bugs, etc. are major issues. If time to market or technical complexity is a concern, documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk.

In the case of ASP.NET, developers can use Microsoft Visual 
Studio to write code. But, as with most other programming languages,
 they can also use a text editor (Notepad++ for example).

Practicing code reuse and using web application frameworks can greatly improve both productivity and time to market (McConnell 1996:537). Reusing externally
developed components can allow an organization to reap the above benefits, while potentially saving money.
